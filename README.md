## Overview

Agents SDK provides an elegant abstraction for creating AI agent systems in PHP, allowing you to:

- Build specialized agents for different tasks
- Connect agents using a handoff mechanism
- Define and use custom tools for external operations
- Stream LLM responses for real-time interactions
- Monitor agent behavior with observers and traces
- Serialize and deserialize conversations for state management
- Connect to external tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Use both the Responses- and Chat Completions API

The SDK is designed to be flexible, extensible, and easy to use while providing a robust foundation for building complex multi-agent based systems.

## Installation

```bash
composer require swisnl/agents-sdk
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of creating and running an Agent that can use a Tool for retrieving weather information:

```php
use Swis\Agents\Agent;
use Swis\Agents\Orchestrator;
use Swis\Agents\Tool;
use Swis\Agents\Tool\Required;
use Swis\Agents\Tool\ToolParameter;

// Define a custom tool
class WeatherTool extends Tool
{
    #[ToolParameter('The name of the city.'), Required]
    public string $city;

    protected ?string $toolDescription = 'Gets the current weather by city.';

    public function __invoke(): ?string
    {
        // Implementation to fetch weather data
        return "Current weather in {$this->city}: Sunny, 22Â°C";
    }
}

// Create an agent with the tool
$agent = new Agent(
    name: 'Weather Assistant',
    description: 'Provides weather information',
    instruction: 'You help users with weather-related questions. Use the WeatherTool to get accurate data.',
    tools: [new WeatherTool()]
);

// Set up the orchestrator
$orchestrator = new Orchestrator();

// Process a user message
$orchestrator->withUserInstruction('What\'s the weather like in Amsterdam?');

// Run the agent and get the response
$response = $orchestrator->run($agent);
echo $response;

// Or use streaming for real-time responses
$orchestrator->runStreamed($agent, function ($token) {
    echo $token;
});
```

## Creating Agents

Agents are the core components of the SDK. They encapsulate a specific role or capability and can use tools to perform actions.

```php
$agent = new Agent(
    name: 'Agent Name',             // Required: Unique identifier for the agent
    description: 'Description',     // Optional: Brief description of the agent's capabilities
    instruction: 'System prompt',   // Optional: Detailed instructions for the agent
    tools: [$tool1, $tool2],        // Optional: Array of tools the agent can use
    handoffs: [$otherAgent]         // Optional: Other agents this agent can hand off to
);
```

## Using Chat Completions API

By default, agents will use the Responses API. You can control what endpoint the agent will use by giving it the correct Transporter.

Note that Native Tools are only supported by the Responses API.

```php
$agent = new Agent(
    name: 'Agent Name',
    transporter: new ChatCompletionsTransporter()
);

// Or
$agent->withTransporter(new ChatCompletionsTransporter());
```

## Defining Tools

Tools are capabilities that agents can use to perform actions. To create a custom tool:

1. Extend the `Tool` class
2. Define parameters using attributes
3. Implement the `__invoke` method with your tool's logic

```php
class SearchTool extends Tool
{
    #[ToolParameter('The search query.'), Required]
    public string $query;
    
    #[ToolParameter('The number of results to return.')]
    public int $limit = 5;

    protected ?string $toolDescription = 'Searches for information.';

    public function __invoke(): ?string
    {
        // Implementation logic here
        return json_encode([
            'results' => [/* search results */]
        ]);
    }
}
```

```php
// Examples with array and object parameters
class ProductSearchTool extends Tool
{
    #[ToolParameter('The product categories to search in.', itemsType: 'string')]
    public array $categories = [];
    
    #[ToolParameter('Filters to apply to the search.', objectClass: SearchFilter:class)]
    public object $filters;
    
    protected ?string $toolDescription = 'Searches for products with advanced filtering.';
    
    ...
}

class SearchFilter
{
    #[ToolParameter('The property to filter.'), Required]
    public string $property;
    
    #[ToolParameter('The value of the filter.'), Required]
    public string $values;;
    
    #[ToolParameter('The operator of the filter.')]
    #[Enum(['eq', 'neq', 'gt', 'lt', 'gte', 'lte'])]
    public string $operator = 'eq';
    
    protected ?string $toolDescription = 'Searches for products with advanced filtering.';
    
    ...
}
```

## MCP Tool Support

The SDK supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) through the `McpConnection` class, allowing you to integrate external data sources and tools with your agents.

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. It provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need, offering:

- Dynamic discovery of available tools
- Tool filtering to restrict which tools are available to agents
- Remote tool invocation

### Using MCP

It's recommended to use the `swis/mcp-client` package for MCP client implementations.

```bash
composer require swisnl/mcp-client
```

To use MCP tools with your agents:

```php
use Swis\Agents\Agent;
use Swis\Agents\Mcp\McpConnection;
use Swis\McpClient\Client;

// Create an MCP connection
$mcpConnection = McpConnection::forSse('http://localhost:3000');

// Optionally restrict which tools are available
$mcpConnection->withTools('calculator', 'weather');

// Create an agent with the MCP connection
$agent = new Agent(
    name: 'Assistant with MCP Tools',
    description: 'An assistant that can use external MCP tools',
    mcpConnections: [$mcpConnection]
);
```

### Advanced MCP Usage

The SDK supports advanced MCP features:

- Tool caching with PSR-6 compatible cache adapters
- Process-based MCP clients for local tools

Example with a local MCP server:

```php
// Create a connection to a local MCP server with process management
$mcpConnection = McpConnection::forProcess(
    command: 'node path/to/mcp-server.js',
    autoRestartAmount: 5
);

// Add caching support
$mcpConnection->withCache($psr6CacheImplementation)
    ->withCacheTtl(1800); // 30 minute cache
```

## Multi-Agent Systems

The SDK supports creating systems of specialized agents that can hand off tasks to each other:

```php
// Create specialized agents
$weatherAgent = new Agent(
    name: 'Weather Agent',
    // ... configuration
);

$travelAgent = new Agent(
    name: 'Travel Agent',
    // ... configuration
    handoffs: [$weatherAgent]  // Travel agent can hand off to Weather agent
);

// Main triage agent
$triageAgent = new Agent(
    name: 'Triage Agent',
    description: 'Routes user requests to the appropriate specialized agent',
    handoffs: [$weatherAgent, $travelAgent]
);
```

## Orchestration

The `Orchestrator` class manages the conversation flow and agent execution:

```php
$orchestrator = new Orchestrator();

// Add a user message
$orchestrator->withUserInstruction("I need help with planning a trip to Amsterdam");

// Run with a specific agent
$response = $orchestrator->run($triageAgent);

// Or stream the response
$orchestrator->runStreamed($triageAgent, function ($token) {
    echo $token;
});
```

## Observability

The SDK provides an observer pattern to monitor agent behavior:

```php
$orchestrator->withAgentObserver(new class extends AgentObserver {
    public function beforeHandoff(AgentInterface $agent, AgentInterface $handoffToAgent, RunContext $context): void
    {
        echo "Handing off from {$agent->name()} to {$handoffToAgent->name()}\n";
    }

    public function onToolCall(AgentInterface $agent, Tool $tool, ToolCall $toolCall, RunContext $context): void
    {
        echo "Agent {$agent->name()} called tool: {$toolCall->tool}\n";
    }
});
```

## Tracing

The SDK includes built-in tracing support using OpenAI Tracing format by default. This helps with debugging and monitoring agent execution.

### Disabling Tracing

You can disable tracing in two ways:

1. On a per-orchestrator basis:
```php
$orchestrator = new Orchestrator();
$orchestrator->disableTracing();
```

2. Globally via environment variable:
```
AGENTS_SDK_DISABLE_TRACING=true
```

Disabling tracing can be useful in production environments or when you don't need the debugging information.

## Example Implementations

The repository includes examples for common use cases:

- `CustomerServiceAgent`: A multi-agent system for customer service with handoffs
- `WeatherAgent`: A simple agent that fetches weather information

Run the examples using:

```php
php examples/play.php
```

## Conversation Serialization

The SDK provides a way to serialize and deserialize conversation state, allowing you to continue conversations at a later time:

```php
use Swis\Agents\Helpers\ConversationSerializer;

// After running some conversation with an orchestrator
$data = ConversationSerializer::serializeFromOrchestrator($orchestrator);
saveToStorage($data); // Your storage implementation

// Later, when you want to continue the conversation
$data = retrieveFromStorage(); // Your retrieval implementation

// Create a new orchestrator with the serialized conversation
$orchestrator = new Orchestrator();
$orchestrator->withContextFromData($data);

$agent = new Agent(/* Create your agent */);

// Continue the conversation
$orchestrator->withUserInstruction('New message');
$response = $orchestrator->run($agent);
```

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- OpenAI API key for LLM access (or other OpenAI compatible API)
- Composer for dependency management

## Testing

The SDK includes a test suite built with PHPUnit. To run the tests:

```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run the tests
composer run test
```

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test the full agent workflow with actual API calls (skipped by default)
